## Sudoku Solver with GUI


This project is a Windows Forms application that allows users to input and solve Sudoku puzzles. The application provides an interactive grid where users can enter Sudoku numbers and solve the puzzle using a built-in algorithm.

## Features
Interactive Grid: Enter and edit Sudoku numbers directly in the grid.
Preset Puzzle: Starts with a predefined Sudoku puzzle.
Real-Time Validation: Ensures that entered numbers do not violate Sudoku rules.
Solve Button: Automatically solves the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
User-Friendly Interface: Visually appealing grid with clear distinction between initial numbers and user inputs.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2019 or later
.NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sudoku-solver.git
Open the solution file (WindowsFormsApp3.sln) in Visual Studio.

Build the project to restore the necessary packages and dependencies.

## Running the Application
Press F5 or click the Start button in Visual Studio to run the application.
The Sudoku grid will be displayed with some preset numbers.
Enter numbers directly into the grid. Valid entries are from 1 to 9.
Click the Solve button to solve the puzzle automatically.
## How to Play
Enter Numbers: Click on a cell and type a number from 1 to 9.
Solve Puzzle: Click the Solve button to let the application solve the puzzle.
Clear Cell: To clear a cell, select it and press the Delete or Backspace key.
How It Works
The Sudoku solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find the solution. The algorithm recursively attempts to place numbers in empty cells while ensuring that each placement adheres to Sudoku rules. If a placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.
